# Steepest-Descent-Algorithm
The input signal is a sinusoidal wave corrupted with added white Gaussian noise is
taken as an input on which the algorithm is implemented which adjusts the weights
and minimizes the error signal. The noise added signal is filtered off iteratively giving
the estimated signal as the output.
